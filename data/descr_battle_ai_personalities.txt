;;These constants can be assigned on a per-faction basis in descr_sm_factions.txt
;;
;;Anything named with "_sq" means that it is the square of the quantity that needs to be specified.
;;	e.g. distance_sq = 2500 means the distance is 50

;;Anything marked [Legacy] means that constant is no longer used.

;;Descriptions are from the perspective of the AI, so the "enemy" is likely the player, and "us" refers to the AI.
