	"Start delay": 0.0,			;;the constant delay before the sound should play when triggered
	"Random delay": 0.233,		;;the maximum random delay added to the constant delay
	"Pref type": "SFX",			;;the slider the sound should be attached to
	"Ignore pause": false,		;;should this sound ignore being paused?
	"Min dist": 3.0,			;;attenuation parameters (n.b. Kraken uses a modified attenuation curve such that V will always equal 0 at the maxdist)

	"Prob radius": 0.0,			;;the range within which the probability will be overridden to be 100%
	"Effect level": 0.0,		;;??? I think this has something to do with the EAX parameters?
