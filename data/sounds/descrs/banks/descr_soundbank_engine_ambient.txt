	"Volume": 100,				;;the volume of the sample as a percentage of the base file's
	"Min pitch": 69.997,		;;the random pitch of the sample (0-200%)
	"Max pitch": 100.0,			
	"Priority": 70,				;;sound with high priority will replace lower priority sounds if all soundchannels are used
	"Fade in": 0.0,				;;the time, in seconds, for the sound to fade in and out
	"Fade out": 0.0,			
	"Looped": false,			;;should the sound loop?
	"Random volume": -10,		;;the random adjustment applied to the volume (must be negative)
	"Start delay": 0.0,			;;the constant delay before the sound should play when triggered
	"Random delay": 0.233,		;;the maximum random delay added to the constant delay
	"Pref type": "SFX",			;;the slider the sound should be attached to
	"Ignore pause": false,		;;should this sound ignore being paused?
	"Min dist": 1.5,			;;attenuation parameters (n.b. Kraken uses a modified attenuation curve such that V will always equal 0 at the maxdist)
	"Max dist": -1.0,			;;setting max dist to -1 will mean the sound will autocalculate the max dist
	"Dist priority": 0.0,		;;how much should the priority be reduced per meter of distance
	"Prob radius": 0.0,			;;the range within which the probability will be overridden to be 100%
	"Effect level": 0.25,		;;??? I think this has something to do with the EAX parameters?
